We have added experimental self-hosting capability to FsShelter library.

This F# implementation of Storm logic allows any process to run the topology entirely inside a .NET process, which might be useful for local development, testing and troubleshooting. 

See the updated [Guranteed sample](https://github.com/Prolucid/FsShelter) for new API details.
