After a year in development the 1.0 stable realease of fable-elmish is [available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=fable.elmish). A journey that took it from one page of prototype code running on ReactNative, to an ecosystem of packages with good support for browser, debugger and HMR and vibrant community is complete. Going beyond this major milestone we can start thinking about supporting NetStandard directly, so that Xamarin and WPF ports of elmish could take the core as a package dependency.
