Just in time for [open fsharp](https://twitter.com/openfsharp) a new major release of libraries supporting our event-stream processing is out and is [available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=FsShelter). This release focused on lowering footprint of self-hosted topologies and introduces several breaking changes in core APIs.
Please see the documentation for details and instructions for migration from v1.x.
